## Motivation

PhotoFilmStrip has a great simple UI to make slideshows. I use it to make videos of my travels.  
First I choose a song as a background. That defines the duration of the video.  
Then I add images. PhotoFilmStrip adds some random animations to every image. That's ok.  
The duration of the image is automatically calculated to fill the song duration. Great.  
I then add subtitles to every image. Eventually, I can modify the animation and change the order of the images.  
The UI is so easy, that even my wife likes to use it.  
Finally, PhotoFilmStrip renders the slideshow as a mp4 file and the subtitles as a srt file. That is fine, but...

I prefer to have the subtitles embedded in the video, so every video player will show them exactly how I want it. I encountered a lot of odd problems with separated srt files.  

There are some technics to embed the subtitles into mp4 using ffmpeg or VLC. But I am a programmer and every problem is an excuse to start a new project. In Rust, of course.

For my video editing, I use Shotcut. It is simple and works for me. I would like to export the PhotoFilmStrip project to Shotcut.  
Shotcut can embed "subtitles" into the video and maybe later I could make some video editing that is not possible in PhotoFilmStrip.

So the problem is simple. I need a simple tool to make a one-time conversion from PhotoFilmStrip to Shotcut.  
After that, I can work in Shotcut to modify the video at my will without the limitations of PhotoFilmStrip.

PhotoFilmStrip saves the project in an SQLite database in a pfs file. I could read that with Rust.  
Shotcut saves the projects in XML format in an mlt file. I could write that in Rust.

It is time to discover the elements of these 2 formats and how to transform them.
